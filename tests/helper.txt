test_attn.py, test_mamba2.py, test_gdn.py : files that check the inference mode of the respective mixers.
                                            more precisely, compares the output between the parallel mode (give the whole input directly, in one forward pass)
                                            and the inference mode (give the input one by one, and carry the cache between each forward pass)

                                            (actually, for the inference mode, there is first a small chunk that is passed in one forward pass
                                            (akin to prompt prefill), this forward pass returns the cache, and then the inference mode goes 1 by 1)
